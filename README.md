## About this repository
This repo contains some of the most relevant case studies and full lab reports (PDFs) from hands-on labs that I completed in the NET-637 Network Intrusion Investigation course from Southeastern Community College using JBL Learning: Ethical Hacking: Techniques, Tools, and Countermeasures, 4th Ed.

All work was performed in a secure, isolated lab environment.

The goal is to demonstrate practical skills and basic understanding, and experience, with common security tools.

More information can be provided upon request.

## Included labs 
### Lab 02 - Performing Active Reconnaissance
Scanned a target network to find live hosts and open ports, captured scan traffic to observe TCP/UDP sequences, and ran vulnerability scans. 
### Lab 03 - Exploiting Vulnerable Hosts
Identified vulnerable Windows and Linux hosts, used Metasploit to gain Meterpreter shells, and cracked captured password hashes.
### Lab 05 - Performing Web Application and Database Attacks
Worked with intentionally vulnerable web apps (DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop) to demonstrate XSS, SQL injection, and command injection.
### Lab 07 - Exploiting Wireless Vulnerabilities
Captured wireless traffic, tested weak encryption configurations, and performed WEP/WPA2 cracking attacks using capture files and wordlists to recover keys/passphrases.
