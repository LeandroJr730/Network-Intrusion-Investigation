## 📝 What I did
* Scanned a network to find live hosts and open ports.
* Captured network traffic to see how scans work.
* Ran vulnerability scans to find problems on machines.
* Created and used a custom scan profile.

## 🛠️ Tools
* Nmap / Zenmap
* Wireshark
* Nessus
* OpenVAS

## 📊 Results 
* Found several IPs and their operating systems.
* Observed TCP (SYN, ACK) and UDP packet sequences.
* Detected vulnerabilities (example: MS17-010).
* Saved screenshots and scan reports.

OBS: The OpenVAS vulnerability scan did not work during the lab, so results were limited for that part.
